pip install selenium

Download Chrome WebDriver:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable

Be sure to upgrade chrome to the same version
https://www.google.com/chrome/update/


Extract and copy path name:
C:\MyTools\Python\chromedriver-win64

To see what directories are already on PATH, open a Command Prompt and execute:

echo %PATH%
If the location to your driver is not already in a directory listed, you can add a new directory to PATH:

setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\MyTools\Python\chrome-win64"
You can test if it has been added correctly by checking the version of the driver:

chromedriver.exe --version
